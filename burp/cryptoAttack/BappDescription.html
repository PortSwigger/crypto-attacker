<p>CryptoAttacker helps detect and exploit some common crypto flaws.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Active Scanning to detect padding Oracle attacks</li>
	<li>Active Scanning capabilities to detect input being encrypted with ECB and reflected back (can be slow)</li>
	<li>Attack tab to encrypt/decrypt padding oracles</li>
	<li>Attack tab to decrypt ECB where you control part of the request</li>
</ul>


<p>I only test this on Burp pro latest version and Jython 2.7 (but please report issues if you have any with different configs)</p>
